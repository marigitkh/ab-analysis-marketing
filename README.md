1. Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset structure and metrics.
2. Statistical testing (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests) to determine the significance of observed differences between groups.
3. Visualization to support conclusions and provide actionable insights.

## Results

The analysis explored the effectiveness of ads compared to public service announcements (PSAs). Results revealed that users exposed to ads had significantly higher purchase probabilities. Statistical hypothesis testing confirmed the impact of targeted advertising on purchase behavior, emphasizing its critical role in influencing consumer decisions. These findings offer valuable guidance for designing future marketing strategies to optimize engagement and sales.
